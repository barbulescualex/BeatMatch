 # BeatMatch
 
 A simple and elegant beat matching game
 
 _______________________________________
 
 Welcome to my Beat Match! A game that uses the AVFoundation, Metal and Accelerate frameworks to provide a beatiful audio visual experience.
 
 #### Inspiration:
 
 I consider myself both a programming and music enthusiest, so when I realized I had no clue how music works and is processed in a digital format I knew I had fill that gap in my knowledge.
 
 #### Resources:
 
 All the sounds were created by me, both the instruments and my voice (obviously ðŸ˜‰), the one PNG asset, the restart button, was also created by me.
